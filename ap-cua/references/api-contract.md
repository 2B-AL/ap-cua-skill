# Gateway REST API contract

The skill talks to the CUA Skill Gateway over HTTPS JSON. You never call this
directly — `scripts/cua.py` does. This is reference only.

Base URL comes from `config.json`, `AP_CUA_SKILL_API_BASE_URL`, or `--api-base-url`.
All paths are under `/v1`.

## Unified envelope

Success:

```json
{ "ok": true, "request_id": "req_...", "data": { }, "error": null }
```

Error:

```json
{ "ok": false, "request_id": "req_...", "data": null,
  "error": { "code": "TOKEN_EXPIRED", "message": "Access token expired.", "retryable": true } }
```

The gateway owns all platform `/api/**` calls (desktops, sessions, runs,
scheduled-tasks, artifacts) behind these stable semantic routes; the skill never
touches the platform directly.

## Auth/me response

```json
{
  "auth_type": "agentplan_api_key",
  "user": { "account_id": "2100...", "project_name": "default", "apikey_id": "ak_..." },
  "scopes": ["cua:read", "cua:invoke", "cua:observe", "cua:cancel"],
  "desktop_bound": true
}
```

## Auth model

- Login: the user provides a Volcengine Ark AgentPlan API key locally.
- Bearer credential: the API key is sent as `Authorization: Bearer`.
- Gateway verification: each business request calls Ark acquire (or uses an
  equivalent verified context) before reaching CUA.
- Runtime model calls: the same API key is passed to CUA so the user's AgentPlan
  quota and permissions are used.

## Privacy

The gateway does not persist the user's objective, answers, final result text,
process traces, screenshots, full desktop access URLs, or artifact contents.
